I’m a **coder** with a keen interest in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and programming. Here's what you can find here:

- 🚀 Running 8B LLMs on low-end hardware (like my RTX 4050!)
- 💻 Building tools using Python & JavaScript
- 🤖 Exploring the potential of open-source AI models

## About Me  
A brief intro about yourself or your interests.

### I like to tinker with code and build practical tools — from CLI scripts to web interfaces. Currently, I'm focused on:

- **Python development** (especially AI/ML projects)
- **Open source contributions**
- **Command-line efficiency**

## 🛠️ Projects

Here are some of my favorite GitHub repositories and personal projects:

### 🔍 1. *DeepSeek-R1 Quantized Models*  
I run a DeepSeek-R1 model locally on limited hardware (like the RTX 4050). Here's how I've optimized it for even low-end GPUs...

```bash
# Example of a technical detail section:
- Used `Ollama` to run DeepSeek-R1:8B in Q4 quantization (~5GB)  
- Optimized context generation with minimal VRAM usage
- Integrated LLMs into CLI tools and web-based interfaces
